# vanilla-js-es6-book-list

This is a book list that practices DOM manipulation and ES6 class construction.

## Front-end
Skeleton css were used for the styling. There are 2 JS files. The first uses pre-ES6 JS and the second uses ES6 JS. The index.html file is configured to used the ES6 JS file but you and easily change the source of the script. Validation was added on the input fields. If any of the input fields are left empty, an error will display. Conversely, a success message will show when all input value validations are met. In both cases, the alert will disappear after 3 seconds. The books added are also saved to Local Storage that can be viewed in the browser. No validation was added for duplicate entries.

## Live Server
VS Code extension Live Server was added. It is launched for the index.html file and will auto-refresh on each save.
